    <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
    <h1>TASK</h1>
    
    <p>The task was for me to design a personal logo which I would be able to use in my personal website.</p>
    <h1>PROCESS</h1>
    <p>Picking the right typography was essential for this specific logo design, because my idea for the logo
         style was based on lettering compositions. Going into this, I had wanted my logo to be minimal but creative;
          Initially, I wanted my logo to have a techno sci-fi look, because I do work with technology and code a lot 
          and I wanted it to denote that. 
        With this in mind, I started sketching down some ideas.</p>
        <img src="../Images/kamo_logo.jpg" alt="" width="320px" height="320px">
        <p>I began to sketch the lettering compositions for the name Kamo, I did not however, like any of the variations 
            that I had came up with for the logo; so,
         I moved to sketching different variations of the letters, starting with the letter K.</p>
         <img src="../Images/variations_K.jpg" alt="sketch showing design variations of the letter K" width="320px" height="320px">
         <p>I looked at different techno sci-fi typographies on a site called dafont.com, chose the ones I liked and moved 
             on to adding extra details to some variations of the letter K. In the process of me doing these sketches, I
              decided that instead of using my name Kamo for the logo, that I should rather use my initials, which are KM. 
              I felt that this would work stylistically, since I am going for a minimalist look for the logo; 
             I then started sketching variations for the initials KM and chose the one that I liked.</p>
             <img src="../Images/VARIATIONS_logo.jpg" alt="variation of logo design" width="320px" height="320px">
             <p>I then moved to making digital drafts, to determine which would work best for my website.</p>
