    <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
    <h1>TASK</h1>
    
    <p>The task was to make an illustration using Ryan Destiny’s image as a reference; the illustration was to be made in CSS. 
        </p>
    <h1>PROCESS</h1>
    <p>My goal going into making this project was to not include all the small details into the illustration, but to rather focus on getting the silhouette right; and to do this, I placed the reference 
        image on the background and started placing shapes on top of it, I used the image as a guide.
        Below is an image that I used as a reference for this illustration.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Ryan.jpg" alt="" width="" height="auto">
        <h1>SHAPES</h1>
        <p>CSS drawings, I have learnt are all about manipulating the shapes and positioning them. I personally used div tags to create my shapes; 
            I created a div tag and gave it a class ‘Character’, this div acted as a container for all the shapes that I made to create my character/illustration
             including the reference image. I also had another container that was just going to house the different parts/shapes that made up the illustration;
              the reason why I added this container was because initially I thought that I would be able to manipulate the color of all the shapes inside this
               container from the container itself, I later learnt that this would not be possible. I did, however, 
            manage to add a box shadow to this second container and that beautifully outlined the silhouette like I wanted.</p>


          <img src="../Images/Ryan_blue-outline.png" alt="">
         <p>Creating different shapes in CSS is all about manipulation of the border radius, and even the manipulation of different borders. 
             For example, when creating a triangle, one would have to create three borders instead of four, that means you would have to create
              each individual border side and give it a size. Two of those sides, the left and the right border would have to have to be transparent, and only the bottom or the 
             top border would have to have a color, giving the illusion of a triangle. See example below.</p>

            <h1>TRIMMING</h1>
             <p>I had to trim some areas in order to get the desired outline and shape; and I did this by adding other shapes and making those shapes transparent
                  to conceal the parts of the illustration that I did not want visible.</p>
