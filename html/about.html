        <p>  Iâ€™m a software developer with a background in XR development and digital arts, passionate about building interactive, user-focused experiences. My work blends creativity and code, from crafting immersive VR training simulations in Unity to building responsive web interfaces such as this portfolio website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
         
        <p>  I'm also expanding into full-stack development with .NET Core and backend technologies, continuously learning to deepen my understanding of scalable, real-world systems. I enjoy the challenge of solving technical problems and creating solutions that are both functional and engaging.</p>
        <p>    Outside of development, I explore 3D modeling, creating digital illustrations, creating branding(Logos and mockups) for small businessess. I also enjoy watching series/cartoons and just going out with friends.</p>
